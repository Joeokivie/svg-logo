# svg-logo

# Description 
Overview:
The SVG Logo Maker project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) challenge that involves creating a console-based application for generating SVG logos. The primary goal of the project is to apply OOP principles to design classes and structures that facilitate the creation of customizable logos with different shapes, colors, and text. Key Components: Shape Classes: The project involves creating classes for different shapes, such as Circle, Square, and Triangle. Each shape class encapsulates properties and methods related to its specific shape, allowing for easy customization. SVG Class: An SVG class is designed to represent the overall SVG image. It includes methods for setting text, shapes, and generating the SVG markup. This class serves as a container for assembling the components of the logo. CLI Class: The CLI (Command Line Interface) class is responsible for interacting with the user. It uses libraries like Inquirer to prompt the user for input regarding text, text color, logo shape, and shape color.

# User Story
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

# Usage
To install node packages and dependencies, run npm i.Â launch the node index.js A series of questions about the process of creating your logo will appear when you launch the SVG logo application.The workspace folder is where svg will be written. use node index.js to start the application.
